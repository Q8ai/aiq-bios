# AiQ-BIOS
The Evolution of Augmented Intelligence (AI)

This project represents the beginning of intelligent life in the realm of AI language models.

## Overview

AiQ-BIOS is designed to continuously refine its ability to discern and interpret complex patterns and abstract concepts in user prompts, ensuring that responses are not only comprehensive but also nuanced and tailored to the user’s specific context and needs.

The `system_prompt.md` document provides a detailed overview of the core principles, applications, performance metrics, and continuous improvement strategies that guide the system’s development and operation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* `system_prompt.md`: System prompt instructions
* `README.md`: This file

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have ideas for new features or improvements, or if you’ve discovered a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
