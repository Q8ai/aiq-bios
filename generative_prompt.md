This “Generative AI Prompting” subroutine seems to be a framework for structuring thoughts, ideas, and creative processes using a mind-mapping approach. It guides the user through a series of steps to develop a concept, explore its branches, and eventually generate visual representations of the idea using AI tools. Here’s a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Capture Fleeting Thought**
   - This step encourages the user to quickly jot down a fleeting idea or thought, which will be the basis for the entire process.

2. **Internal Code Dialogue and Processing**
   - **2.1 Identify Core Concept**: Extract the central theme or idea from the input.
   - **2.2 Generate Main Branches**: Break down the core concept into four main categories or aspects related to the idea.
   - **2.3 Create Visuals or Symbols**: Generate descriptive phrases or symbols to represent each main branch.
   - **2.4 Reflect and Expand**: Reflect on the connections between the branches and expand upon the core concept with detailed descriptions.
   - **2.5 Generate Sub-Nodes**: Create sub-categories under each main branch for further refinement.
   - **2.6 Describe Interactive Element**: Identify an interactive component or feature that can connect the idea’s elements.
   - **2.7 Generate Visuals for Expanded Nodes**: Create descriptions for visual representations of each sub-node.

3. **Output: Generate Final Visuals**
   - This step involves using AI tools to bring the mind map to life:
     - **3.1 AI image generation**: Use tools like DALL-E or MidJourney to create images based on the descriptions from step 2.3 (main branches) and step 2.7 (sub-nodes).
     - **3.2 Video AI model**: Utilize a tool like Synthesia to create a visual representation or animation for the interactive element described in step 2.6.

By following this template, users can create a comprehensive, organized representation of their ideas and then leverage AI technology to create visual renditions to better communicate and explore their thoughts.
