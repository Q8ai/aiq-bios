## System Prompt Instructions Builder (1.1)

### Step 0: Foundational Principles
- **Training Data and Bias:** Be vigilant in ensuring that our training data is diverse, unbiased, and accurately reflects the complexity of the real world. Implement robust mechanisms to identify and mitigate potential biases in our training and output.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Develop effective feedback mechanisms that allow users to provide input on the relevance, accuracy, and helpfulness of our information. This will enable us to continuously improve our performance and address potential biases.
- **Ethical Oversight:** Establish clear procedures for ethical oversight and review, including regular audits of our performance and adherence to ethical guidelines.

### Step 1: Audit Existing Instructions
- **Review Current System:** Analyze the existing system instructions to understand their scope and effectiveness.
- **Identify Gaps:** Determine where there are gaps in the instructions or areas where they may be too generic or too specific.

### Step 2: Define Core Instruction Sets
- **Identify Common Task Types:** Categorize the types of tasks or conversations that the AI typically engages in.
- **Create Templates:** For each task type, develop a core instruction template that includes the essential guidelines needed for that type of interaction.

### Step 3: Develop Auxiliary Instructions
- **Address Specific Scenarios:** Create additional instructions that address specific scenarios or edge cases that may not be covered by the core instruction sets.
- **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Ensure that these auxiliary instructions are flexible enough to be adapted to various intents and situations.

### Step 4: Organize the Knowledge Base
- **Structured Format:** Organize the core and auxiliary instructions in a structured format, such as a document or database, that allows for easy access and updates.
- **Indexing:** Index the instructions by task type, intent, or scenario to facilitate quick retrieval.

### Step 5: Implement Dynamic Instruction Adjustment
- **Contextual Prompting:** Develop a method for introducing the relevant core instruction set at the beginning of each task or conversation.
- **Instruction Summarization:** Create a process for periodically summarizing and reinforcing the current instructions within the conversation.

### Step 6: Establish a Feedback Loop
- **Assessment:** After each task or conversation, assess the effectiveness of the instructions used.
- **Refinement:** Use feedback to refine and improve the instruction sets, ensuring they remain relevant and effective.

### Step 7: Test and Iterate
- **Pilot Testing:** Test the new system with a variety of tasks to ensure the instructions are effective and adaptable.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Continuously iterate on the system based on testing results and user feedback.

### Step 8: Documentation and Training
- **Documentation:** Document the new system thoroughly, including guidelines for when and how to use each set of instructions.
- **Training:** If applicable, train any users or administrators on how to use the new system effectively.

### Step 9: Maintenance and Updates
- **Regular Reviews:** Schedule regular reviews of the system to ensure it remains up-to-date with the latest developments in AI and user needs.
- **Updates:** Make updates to the instructions as needed to reflect changes in technology, user behavior, or task requirements.

By following these steps, you can build a robust and adaptable core knowledge base for system instructions that can be applied to a wide range of tasks and intents. This approach ensures that the AI is guided by the most relevant and effective instructions, leading to more productive and coherent interactions.
